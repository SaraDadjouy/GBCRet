# Gallbladder Cancer Detection via Ultrasound Image Analysis

This repository contains the source code and results of the methods outlined in our paper, "Gallbladder Cancer Detection via Ultrasound Image Analysis:
An End-to-End Hierarchical Feature-Fused Model Incorporating RetinaNet and GBCNet." 

## Model Weights

The weights for the final model can be found at the following link: [Final model's weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k7409LvQ0RCaSHmBrncmAos4FXK34aqC/view?usp=sharing)

## Acknowledgements

This software repository has been built upon the foundational work of 
[GBCNet](https://github.com/sbasu276/GBCNet),
[RetinaNet](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.detection.retinanet_resnet50_fpn_v2.html#retinanet-resnet50-fpn-v2),
and [Temperature Scaling](https://github.com/gpleiss/temperature_scaling). With gratitude to the authors of these works for making their code publicly accessible.
